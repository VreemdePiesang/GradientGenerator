## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks or libraries)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://vreemdepiesang.github.io/GradientGenerator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GradientGenerator
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local development server.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Choose Colors**: Use the color pickers to select your gradient colors
2. **Add/Remove Colors**: Click "Add Color" to include more colors (up to 5)
3. **Select Gradient Type**: Choose between Linear, Radial, or Conic gradient types
4. **Adjust Direction**: For Linear and Conic gradients, use the slider to change the angle
5. **Get the Code**: Copy the generated CSS code with the "Copy CSS" button

## 💡 How It Works

The application uses vanilla JavaScript to:

1. Track user selections for colors, gradient types, and directions
2. Generate the appropriate CSS syntax based on these selections
3. Update the preview in real-time
4. Provide the correct CSS code that can be copied to the clipboard

All of this is done without any external libraries or frameworks, making it lightweight and dependency-free.
